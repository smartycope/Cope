# Cope

This is my personal "standard library" of all the generally useful code I've written for various projects over the years. Pretty much any time I've written a function or class and thought "this might be useful later", I've stuffed it in here. As such, a lot of it is super useful, a lot of it is garbage, and a lot of it has become obsoleted as I've learned more and found new libraries. I've tried to keep it clean and organized, but there is a lot of it. I also have tests written for a bunch of it, but not all. The debug function in particular I'm especially proud of. I've spent more time than is reasonable on it.
